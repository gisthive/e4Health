Vendor folder is not commited due to .gitignore... If however needed, i can always use -f to bypass and sendit to you.

To make it possible to use the web application if you did happen to clone it, I used a remote mysqlserver... Hope it serves its purpose.

I'll continue to make changes to the readme file as I continue coming up with ideas on how yo be helpful
